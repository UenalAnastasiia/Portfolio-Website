            I am a Front-end developer based in Germany. My way in web development starter 1 year ago
            when I took a course from Developer Akademie.
            I have devoted a lot of time to learning and practicing coding.
            <br><br>
            Before getting to know web development, I completed a master's degree in finance and a master's degree in
            Ukranian-German translation in Ukraine.
            <br><br>
            I've always dreamed of being an independent and self-sufficient person. As well as I enjoyed acquiring new knowledge and putting it into practice. So
            I'm looking for new challenges as a Front-end developer.
